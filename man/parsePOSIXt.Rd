\title{Parse POSIXct objects from character variables}
\usage{
parsePOSIXt(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of type character, integer or numeric with
date(time) expressions to be parsed and converted.}
}
\value{
A vector of \code{Datetime} objects with \sQuote{POSIXct} elements.
}
\description{
This function uses the Boost Date_Time library to parse
datetimes (and dates) from strings. It returns a
\code{DatetimeVector} ie a vector of \sQuote{POSIXct}
objects.
}
\details{
A numer of fixed formats are tried in succession. These include
the standard ISO format \sQuote{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS} as well as
different local variants including several forms popular in the
United States.  Two-digits years and clearly ambigous formats such
as \sQuote{03/04/05} are ignored.  In the case of parsing failure
a \code{NA} value is returned.

Fractional seconds are supported as well.  As R itself only supports
microseconds, the Boost compile-time option for nano-second resolution
has not been enabled.
